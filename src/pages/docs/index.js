                                                In order to create and manage bounties on PRHunter, you need to install the PRHunter Github App.
                                            </p>
                                            <p className="font-weight-bold">

                                                The app needs permission to read repository data and modify PR's in order to work correctly. Once the app is installed, you can create and manage bounties for all repositories that have been access to.

Just please make sure you're not removing permissions to any repositories that you have active bounties with.

                                                If you don't have any active bounties this action is harmless, however uninstalling the app with bounties active will be considered potentially fraudulent behaviour.

                                            <p>
                                                In order to create a bounty, go to the Dashboard from the user menu in the top right corner after signing in and click "Post a new bounty".
                                                Pick a repository and an issue for which you wish to set up a bounty and fill in the form details.
                                                Currently the bounty creation *does not* interact with actual smart contracts and is only for demonstration purposes. However, once the app is live additional steps will be required:
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                After you fill in the bounty details, you will be required to deposit the bounty amount to the smart contract for a certain period (we're currently thinking about 2-3 weeks minimum).
                                                The funds will be stored in the smart contract and will be payed out to whoever completes the bounty. If the bounty is not completed within that time period, the funds are returned to your metamask wallet,
                                                although you will have the option to resubmit the bounty.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                The bounty submitter will be the one paying the gas fees. We're also planning a small maintenance fee to support the development of the platform.
                                            </p>

                                                Unfortunately Github currently does not have an option to tie a PR with an issue 1-1 - you can have multiple PR's published and a merge of a PR is not synonomous with the solving of an issue.
                                                This is a limation we'll be trying to solve as elegantly as possible in future development effort.
