### Announcing PRHunter.io


Earlier this year, as I was working on a different project, I was looking for help with some web development. As you can probably tell from the looks of this site, frontend isn't exactly my thing. I decided to get someone to help me out - not for free, of course. I checked upwork initially, then I searched some facebook groups, then I conducted a small technical interview and found the right person. It took me a certain amount of effort to find and verify that the person I'm willing to hire can get the job done. But what if I could get rid of that part completely? <br/>


I aleady had a design, I knew what I wanted to get, so what I *really* needed was for someone to write some code according to specification. I just wanted to pay X to whoever gets the job done. <br/>


**And that's what PRHunter is all about. You publish Bounties on Github issues, someone solves these issues for you, you pay them.**

Do you have a side project but got stuck and would like someone to help you out? Go ahead and post a Bounty! 

Are you missing a critical feature in some open-source library that you've been waiting for ages? No problem, just fork it on Github and post a Bounty!

Perhaps your company doesnt't have the time to patch all the holes in your code, because all of your devs are too busy? PRHunter should be able to help out with that too (one day)


  

The project is currently in a pretty early stage, but we're aiming to be functional in Q1 2021 - if you're interested please check out our <a href="/docs">docs</a> and FAQ, we're looking for all feedback we can get. Help us make PRHunter awesome!
